# breast-cancer
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. About 25% of cancer cases world-wide are breast cancer cases. People in Wisconsin are 'allegedly' more likely to develope breast cancer. We are going to compare cancer rates in the US to cancer rates in Wisconsin. This will lead to further research into the causes of such a disparity.

Questions we might explore: 

How does the distribution of tumor characteristics in Wisconsin compare to national averages?
- Are tumors in the Wisconsin data set more irregular, more aggresive, etc.

Are Wisconsin malignancy rates similar to U.S. malignancy rates?
- What proportion of cases are malignant in the Wisconsin dataset?

What features most strongly distinguish malignant from benign tumors?
- What kind of cluster characteristics are there?
